Jamie Thingelstad [writes in his blog](https://www.thingelstad.com/2025/01/12/if-i-was-born-and.html):

> Having a blog is like having a single family home. Want to remodel? Okay. Want to play your stereo? Okay, within the noise ordinances. Want to change the way the living room is laid out? Fine, none of our business. This is why I have a blog. I want to have my own space, and do my own things, and not be under a landlord. That also means I have to mow my grass, tend to the rain gutters, and manage the upkeep. And just like houses some take more of that than others.

I couldn’t agree more. What’s more, I think it doesn’t have to have a single theme or purpose.

When I first started blogging, I questioned what content belongs here.
Should it be a diary of daily events? A collection of polished essays? A tech blog? A personal journal?

Well, it can be all of these things and more. It’s **my own** digital space after all and I’m free to do whatever I feel like doing.

This is what I enjoy most about personal sites and blogs: people building their own cosy spaces to express themselves, connect with others, and welcome guests - not to sell products or services.

I like having guests and enjoy connecting with people, but I build my home first of all for myself and my family, not for the people who visit me.
The same applies to my digital space.

As [Lars once put](https://lars-christian.com/posts/2024-07-22-re-do-people-irl-know-you-have-a-blog/):
