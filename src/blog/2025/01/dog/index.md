We've been thinking about bringing a dog into our family for a while. None of us had experience with having a dog in adulthood, plus we weren't sure how our cat would handle it. So we decided that we would first take someone else's dog into our home for a day or two.

Yesterday, a friend of ours brought their dog over for a sleepover. To our surprise, the experience went quite well. The cat wasn't really happy, but they mostly ignored each other. The dog also behaved well, sleeping through the night peacefully on the couch. He isn't really the playful type but loves sitting on laps and is really good with basic commands.

I think that next time, when the friends go on vacation, we'll have him for longer to get an even better sense of what full-time dog ownership might be like.
