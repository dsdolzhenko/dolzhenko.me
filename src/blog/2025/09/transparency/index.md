title: A take on transparency
---

A colleague of mine shared an interesting perspective on transparency the other day.
It was in the context of decision-making in a corporate environment:

> It's not about everyone taking part in making the decision.
>
> It's not about telling everyone everything about what you're doing at every point during the decision-making process.
>
> It's about providing sufficient context and reasoning behind the decisionâ€”explaining why the decision was made.
>
> Too little information leaves people confused, anxious, and potentially resentful; too much can overwhelm or distract from what actually matters.
