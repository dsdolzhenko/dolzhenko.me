## Family

On Saturday morning, we went to Leiden.
Initially, we just wanted to walk around the old city centre and watch some historic mills, but shortly after arriving, we decided to visit the [Naturalis Biodiversity Center](https://www.naturalis.nl/en).
They have a huge collection of objects and some interactive exhibits.
We enjoyed the exhibition, though it might be too advanced for a three-year-old.
We may visit again in a year or two.

## Work

On Wednesday, I went to the office to meet up with a colleague from the Munich office.
I rarely go to the office as there aren't many people there I work with directly.
But it's always nice to meet in person with those I do work with often.

## Running

I'm gradually getting back on track.
I had three easy runs and a long commute to work on Wednesday, biking both ways as a form of cross-training.
I'm still far from the peak form I had in October, but it already feels much better than a month ago.

I have a half-marathon planned for this October, but I was also thinking about setting a goal for the end of the year.
For example, running 1000km in total by December 31st.

## Projects

I [hacked a prototype](https://github.com/dsdolzhenko/morning-paper) for an RSS reader I've been thinking about for a while.
I'm not satisfied with the UX of existing readers I've seen so far, so I decided to experiment a bit.
For now, it's just a statically generated website (using Eleventy).
I may write a dedicated post later next week with more details on the project.

## Internet

We've got a new internet connection.
KPN installed fibre optic in our building earlier this year, and they approached me suggesting a switch, [which I did a few weeks ago](/blog/2025/03/week-notes-3-9-mar/).

The switch went seamlessly.
A box with cables, a fibre optic box, and a Wi-Fi router arrived a few days before the designated date.
Once I connected it to the fibre optic connection point and enabled the device, the new internet connection started working immediately. The previous connection stopped a few minutes after that.

The only challenge was that the fibre optic connection point I was supposed to connect to was placed in the fuse box cabinet outside the apartment.
It's out of Wi-Fi range, and there are no power sockets there to connect any electrical device.
So I had to drill a hole in the wall between the cabinet and the storage room and place all the devices there.
