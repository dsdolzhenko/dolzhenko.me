# Family

We went to [Sassenheim](https://osm.org/go/0E4aMg1F--) to watch [the Bloemencorso Bollenstreek flower parade](https://bloemencorso-bollenstreek.nl/en/).
It's an annual event that has been taking place since 1947.
In a few words: sun, music, and lots of flowers.
So many flowers that you can smell them standing 15 meters from the floats.

# Running

This Sunday, I participated in a local running event and ran 10 km.
Despite a long winter break, I managed to improve my last year's result at the same event by 5 minutes.
Better yet, I felt much better after the run.
