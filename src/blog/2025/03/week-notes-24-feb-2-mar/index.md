Here we go, I've decided to experiment with this format;
I don't have any particular plan or structure in mind other than posting weekly some sort of a reflection on the past week.
I’ll try to figure it out as I go.

- I started reading [Nexus: A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/204927599-nexus) by Yuval Noah Harari.
- I’m trying to get back to running after an unintentional winter break.
  I have a couple of running events planned this year: a 10K in April and a 21K in October.
- In the middle of the week, I got some time to [hack on my Emacs config](https://github.com/dsdolzhenko/.emacs.d/commits/main/?since=2025-02-23&until=2025-03-02) and tidied it up a bit.
- We watched [Gladiator II](https://letterboxd.com/film/gladiator-ii/), which was meh.
- By the end of the weekend, Thekla fell ill with a temperature reaching 40C. I hope she recovers soon.

Here are a few links to news and blog posts that had my attention this week:

- [What’s New in Emacs 30.1?](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/whats-new-in-emacs-301) by Mickey Petersen
- [Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude Code](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/24/claude-37-sonnet-and-claude-code/) by Simon Willison
- [Choose optimism](https://stephango.com/optimism) by Steph Ango
- [You Don't Have to Monetize The Things You Love](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/you-dont-have-to-monetize-the-things-you-love/) by Joan Westenberg

That’s it for now. See you next week.
