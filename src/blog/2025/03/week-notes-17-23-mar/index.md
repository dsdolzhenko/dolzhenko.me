title: Week notes (17 - 23 Mar)
---

## Personal

I went to Den Haag (Hague) on Thursday to pick up a new external passport from the Russian consulate [I applied for in October](/blog/2024/10/half-day-off-in-den-haag/).
Spent the morning working from [the Central Library](https://osm.org/go/0E4DAtlmV?node=2718101139).
It’s a really nice place if you need a quiet and spacious place to work or study.

On Saturday, we all together spent the first half of the day in Haarlem, strolling around the city centre.
Haarlem is such a nice and cosy city, we like it much more than the crowded Amsterdam.

We also visited, unplanned, [De Koepel](https://dekoepel.com/over-de-koepel-haarlem/) - a former dome-shaped prison renovated into a public space in 2020.

## Blog

I’ve removed the “Now” page from this site.
Now that I have “Week notes” I don’t see a reason to keep a “Now” page as the content of those overlap greatly.
Besides, I haven’t updated my “Now” page for a while.

## Tech

[Jack Baty posted about](https://baty.net/posts/2025/03/espanso-again) [Espanso](https://espanso.org) the other day.
I’ve never heard of it before, so decided to try it.
It has impressive extension and scripting capabilities, let’s see if I find use for them.
So far, I’ve experimented with expansion of emoji and [images](https://espanso.org/docs/matches/basics/#image-matches).

I’m experimenting with [vterm](https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm) (terminal emulator for Emacs) as an alternative to the native macOS Terminal.app.
