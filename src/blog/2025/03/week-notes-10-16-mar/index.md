How was your week?


- All my side project activities these weeks revolve around either tinkering with Emacs or my blog. This is fine, but I wish I had more time and energy to build or explore other things.
- Work and personal life were quite uneventful this week. My schedule is starting to stabilize though, and I may soon have more time for things I've postponed for several months

Here are a few links to videos and blog posts that had my attention this week:

- [Hereâ€™s how I use LLMs to help me write code](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/) by Simon Willison.
- [Functional Tests As A Tree Of Continuations](https://www.evanmiller.org/functional-tests-as-a-tree-of-continuations.html) by Evan Miller.
- [Why aren't we all getting rich from compound interest?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwEVYlkopTY) by Gary Stevenson.
- [We should have more friction in our lives](https://cassidoo.co/post/introduce-friction/) by Cassidy Williams.

See you!
