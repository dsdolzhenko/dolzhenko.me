Last year, around this time, I learned how to bake sourdough bread and began baking a loaf every other morning throughout the whole winter and into early spring.

With winter approaching again, the days are getting colder and darker.
I thought it would be nice to bring back the routine of having a warm, freshly baked loaf on the breakfast table.

The starter, I used last year, obviously didn’t survive.
So, I’m growing a new one, and after a few days of feeding, it’s coming to live! 😍

I followed [the same recipe](https://www.theclevercarrot.com/2019/03/beginner-sourdough-starter-recipe/) I used last year with a few adjustments.

### Creating the starter

   - Add **60 g of whole wheat flour** and **60 g of lukewarm water** into a jar, mix it until smooth.
   - Cover the jar with a lid and place it in a **warm spot for about 48 hours**.

   You can use any type of flour, but higher protein content typically yields better results.
   Make sure that the water it’s chlorine free. I use unfiltered tap water.

   Finding a warm spot doesn’t need to be complicated.
   The warmer the place, the faster the starter will grow.
   I place the jar in a slightly open oven with the light on—it’s usually warm enough.

   After **24 hours**, check the starter.
   You may see bubbles, but it’s not guaranteed at this stage.
   You might also notice a layer of brown liquid called hooch, which is perfectly normal.
   Hooch indicates that the starter needs feeding—just pour it off and proceed to the next step.

### Feeding
   After **48 hours** (or when you notice the first signs of hooch), it’s time to begin daily feedings.

   - Add equal amounts of flour and water to the starter—**60 g of flour** and **60 g of water** in my case—and mix well.
   - Before each feeding, discard a portion of the starter to maintain a manageable size.

   The recipe I followed recommends gradually increasing the total yield during the first week, with specific amounts for each day.
   However, my approach is more flexible. I do use a kitchen scale, though.
   Every time, I discard roughly the same amount—or more—than I’m about to add.

   Repeat this process daily for about 6–7 days, and your starter should be ready.
   You’ll know it’s active when it’s full of bubbles of various sizes, has a spongy texture, and smells pleasantly tangy.
   The last one is subjective, though—my wife didn't enjoy it at any stage 🤢.

That’s it!
In a few more days, I should have a lively, bubbly starter ready to bake a delicious loaf of sourdough bread.
