This afternoon, we had an unplanned family trip to the shopping mall in the city center.
My wife was taking daughter to a drawing class there and I decided to join them and work a bit from the library near by.

On the way there, my wife went to pick-up her glasses, while the rest of us got a little treat in [Patagonias](https://patagonias.nl/over-patagonias-ijssalon-amstelveen/#).
It's small-business shop that offers delicious homemade gelato in many flavours. I can't recommend it enough, if you going to be anywhere around.
