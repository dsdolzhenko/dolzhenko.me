## TL;DR

I use [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) with a custom theme. I don't use any analytics or user tracking tools.
The site is hosted in the [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/) and is served with [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/).
The source code is at [codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/dsdolzhenko/dolzhenko.me).
And I use [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) to author posts and edit the website's source code.

## Content

The site is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a simple static site generator written in JavaScript.
I like it because it provides a perfect balance of control and complexity.
With it, I have control over every piece of the site and don't have to rely on a SaaS solution.

I use a custom theme with minimal runtime dependencies.

All the content, including images, templates and styles, is in a git repository hosted at [codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/dsdolzhenko/dolzhenko.me).

## Privacy

I intentionally avoid using any analytics or user tracking tools. First of all, for privacy reason but also because I don't want your browser to load anything that is not related to the content of the website.

## Hosting

The site is hosted on a small shared Linux server in the [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/), which requires minimal maintenance and costs just 3.98 EUR per month.

The content is served using [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), an excellent, hassle-free web server with sensible defaults and built-in SSL certificate issuance.

## Editing

[GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is my editor of choice for both coding and text editing.

I have a few bash scripts to automate editing and publication.
