Depending on the day and time, I am probably doing one of the following things at the moment:

- It's an early morning: I'm jogging, studying or working on a pet project.
- It's a weekday: I'm coding, having a meeting, or planning.
- It's a weekday evening: I'm reading a book, blogging, or working on a pet project.
- It's a weekend: I'm outside in one of the nearby parks with my family.
- It's a Sunday morning: I'm taking my daughter to the little gym.
- It's a Sunday evening: I'm having a weekly video conference with my parents and sister.
- It's a Friday or weekend late evening: I'm watching a movie or TV series with my wife.

## Books

I usually read several books at a time, all on different topics. Right now, I'm reading:

- [Blue Machine](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL28806575W/Blue_Machine) by Helen Czerski
- [The Software Engineer's Guidebook](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL36893254W/The_Software_Engineer%27s_Guidebook) by Gergely Orosz
- [Mastering Emacs](https://www.masteringemacs.org/book) by Mickey Petersen

## Music

My music preferences have shifted lately from Electronic and Ambient to Alternative Rock.

## Podcasts

I don't have much time to listen to podcasts these days, and there are only a few left that I listen to more or less regularly, mostly while running:

- [Hemispheric Views](https://hemisphericviews.com/)
- [Lex Fridman Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/)
- [DevZen Podcast](https://devzen.ru/)

## TV

Every weekend we watch a movie or two. Check out my [letterboxd.com](https://letterboxd.com/dsdolzhenko/films/by/rated-date/) profile.

When we don't have movies to watch, we watch [Tales from the Loop](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8741290/) or [The Acolyte](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12262202).
