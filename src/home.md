Hi there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I publish my stories, thoughts and ideas.

My name's Dmitry or Dima. I'm a father, husband, and software engineer living in The Netherlands, Amstelveen.

In my free time, you'll often find me hanging out with family, experimenting with new coffee brewing methods, trying out new recipes, running, or diving into a good book. Occasionally, I like to tinker with tech stuff too.

ðŸ‘‹ If you want to say hi, write me [an email](mailto:mailbox@dolzhenko.me).
