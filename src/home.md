Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I publish my stories, thoughts and ideas.

I'm a father, husband, and software engineer living in The Netherlands, Amstelveen.

In my free time, you'll often find me hanging out with family, experimenting with new coffee brewing methods, trying out new recipes, learning guitar, or diving into a good book. Occasionally, I like to tinker with tech stuff too.

If you're interested what I'm currently up to, check out my [now](/now) page.

I love reading other people's blogs, you can find my favourites on the [blogroll](/blogroll) page.

The site has a [colophon](/colophon) page if you're interested to know how it's built.
