Hi there ðŸ‘‹! Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I publish my stories, thoughts and ideas.

As you can guess my name is Dmitry. I'm a father, husband, and software engineer living in The Netherlands, Amstelveen.

In my free time, you'll often find me hanging out with family, experimenting with new coffee brewing methods, trying out new recipes, learning guitar, or diving into a good book. Occasionally, I like to tinker with tech stuff too.

If you're interested what I'm currently up to, check out my [now](/now) page.

I love reading other people's blogs, you can find my favorites on the [blogroll](/blogroll) page.

You can follow me on <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@dsdolzhenko">Mastodon</a>, connect with me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%F0%9F%91%BE-dmitry-dolzhenko-213087203/), or write me an email to [mailbox@dolzhenko.me](mailto:mailbox@dolzhenko.me).
