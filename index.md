Hi there ðŸ‘‹! Welcome to my little internet garden - a place where I publish thoughts, stories and ideas of mine.

As you can guess my name is Dmitry Dolzhenko. I'm a father, husband, and software engineer living in The Netherlands, Amsterdam.

In my spare time, you may catch me hanging out with my family, experimenting with a new coffee brewing method, trying out a new recipe, learning how to play the guitar, or reading a book. Sometimes, I like to mess around with tech stuff.

If you're interested what I'm currently up to, check out my [now](/now) page.

I love reading other people's blogs, you can find my favorites on the [blogroll](/blogroll) page.

You can follow me on <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@dsdolzhenko">Mastodon</a>
