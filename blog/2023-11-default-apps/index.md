What is the best way to restart a blog if not by joining a recent trend in blogosphere for fun.

I first saw this on [Kev Quirk's blog](https://kevquirk.com/my-default-apps-at-the-end-of-2023), but it all started with ["Duel of the Defaults!"](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097) episode of [Hemispheric Views](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/) podcast:

I'm an avid Emacs user, so it appears more than once in the list. The original list of categories doesn't include coding, for which I obviously also use Emacs when possible 😛. It is my default app for almost all text related tasks. But for many other categories, I really just use *default* apps.

So, here are the apps I use:

- 📨 Mail Client: Mail.app
- 📮 Mail Server: Fastmail
- 📝 Notes: Emacs (org-roam)
- ✅ To-Do: Emacs (org-mode)
- 📷 iPhone Photo Shooting: Lock-screen button
- 🟦 Photo Management: Photos.app
- 📆 Calendar: Calendar.app
- 📁 Cloud File Storage: Apple iCloud
- 📖 RSS: Emacs (elfeed)
- 🙍🏻‍♂️ Contacts: Contacts.app
- 🌐 Browser: Firefox on Desktop, Safari on Mobile
- 💬 Chat: Telegram
- 🔖 Bookmarks: Firefox, Safari
- 📑 Read It Later: Emacs (org-mode)
- 📜 Word Processing: Emacs (org-mode), Google Docs
- 📈 Spreadsheets: Google Sheets
- 📊 Presentations: Google Sheets
- 🛒 Shopping Lists: Apple Reminder
- 🍴 Meal Planning: N/A
- 💰 Budgeting and Personal Finance: N/A
- 📰 News: N/A
- 🎵 Music: Spotify
- 🎤 Podcasts: Apple Podcasts
- 🔐 Password Management: 1Password

And some extra categories not mentioned in the podcast:

- 🧮 Code Editor: Emacs
