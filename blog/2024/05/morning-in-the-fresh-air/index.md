The summer is coming here in the Netherlands, and the gloomy days are nearly over.
I spent the entire morning working outdoors, enjoying the weather.
It was challenging to find a spot without flies and direct sunlight, though.

I'm seriously considering investing in a comfy folding chair and a solar laptop charger.
