There are at least four open farms within a 30-minute bike ride from us. This Saturday, we went to one of them for the first time since winter.

This particular farm isn't our favorite, but being the closest makes it perfect for a lazy weekend family trip.

Visiting such a farm is a great way to spend a few hours with a small kid outdoors, especially when you've exhausted all the playgrounds in the neighborhood.
