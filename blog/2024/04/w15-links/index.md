title: Links from last week (#2)
---

Here are a few links to things I found interesting last week.

## [unix] [Why Do Long Options Start with Two Dashes?](https://blog.djmnet.org/2019/08/02/why-do-long-options-start-with/)

Ever wondered why parameter names for many command line programs starts with `--`?

## [unikraft] [Unikraft: fast, specialized unikernels the easy way](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447786.3456248)

I continue playing with Unikraft and exploring the fascinating world of unikikernels. Here is a paper from Unikraft team about its Unikraft architecture, design decisions, performance with comparison to other OSs.

## [irc] [ZNC - IRC Bouncer](https://wiki.znc.in/Introduction)

I'm giving IRC another try. One thing that annoyed me is that every time I close laptop lid or internet connection drops I miss part of the conversation. Turned out there is a solution for that.

I deployed ZNC on my lab server, the process is quite straightforward, and now connect through it with [Textual](https://www.codeux.com/textual/).
