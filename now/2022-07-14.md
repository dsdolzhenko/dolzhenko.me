# Family

It's been almost two years since we moved to the Netherlands. And recently "we" has become three of us.

We're renting a nice apartment in Amsterdam Zuidas. However, a few months ago started looking for our own apartment. I hope we will move a house next month, finger crossed.

# Work

At JetBrains I'm working on a number of projects right now. Juggling with multiple contexts is not an easy task, so I'm trying to minimise this number.

The most exciting project is building an integrated video conferencing for JetBrains Space. There are plenty of work to do yet, but we are eager to release it soon.
